# Lab 03: Retrieve Azure Storage resources and metadata by using the Azure Storage SDK for .NET

## Microsoft Azure user interface

Given the dynamic nature of Microsoft cloud tools, you might experience Azure user interface (UI) changes that occur after the development of this training content. As a result, the lab instructions and lab steps might not align correctly.

Microsoft updates this training course when the community alerts us to needed changes. However, cloud updates occur frequently, so you might encounter UI changes before this training content updates. **If this occurs, adapt to the changes, and then work through them in the labs as needed.**

## Multi Path Labs

This lab has been structured to give learners a choice in their lab experience. There are three approaches to progress through this lab

- Path 1 (Low-Code - quick or non-dev approach)
- Path 2 (Standard - typical lab implementation - recommended)
- Path 3 (Advanced - limited code given)

## Instructions

### Before you start

#### Sign in to the lab environment

Sign in to your Windows 11 virtual machine (VM) by using the following credentials:

- Username: `Admin`
- Password: `Pa55w.rd`

> **Note**: Your instructor will provide instructions to connect to the virtual lab environment.

#### Review the installed applications

Find the taskbar on your Windows 11 desktop. The taskbar contains the icons for the applications that you'll use in this lab, including:

-   Microsoft Edge
-   File Explorer

## Lab Scenario

In this lab, you will learn how to use the Azure Storage SDK to access Azure Storage containers within a C# application. You will also learn how to access metadata and expose URI information to gain access to the contents of the containers in the storage account.

### Exercise 1: Create Azure resources

#### Task 1: Open the Azure portal

1. On the taskbar, select the **Microsoft Edge** icon.

1. In the browser window, browse to the Azure portal at `https://portal.azure.com`, and then sign in with the account you'll be using for this lab.

   > **Note**: If this is your first time signing in to the Azure portal, you'll be offered a tour of the portal. Select **Get Started** to skip the tour and begin using the portal.

#### Task 2: Create a Storage account

1. In the Azure portal, use the **Search resources, services, and docs** text box to search for **Storage Accounts**, and then in the list of results, select **Storage Accounts**.

1. On the **Storage accounts** blade, select **+ Create**.

1. On the **Create a storage account** blade, on the **Basics** tab, perform the following actions, and then select **Next: Advanced**:

   | Setting | Action |
   | -- | -- |
   | **Subscription** drop-down list | Retain the default value |
   | **Resource group** section | Select **Create new**, enter **StorageMedia**, and then select **OK** |
   | **Storage account name** text box | Enter **mediastor**_[yourname]_ |
   | **Region** drop-down list | Select **(US) East US** |
   | **Performance** section | Select the **Standard** option |
   | **Redundancy** drop-down list | select **Locally-redundant storage (LRS)** |

   The following screenshot displays the configured settings on the **Create a storage account blade**.

1. On the **Advanced** tab, ensure **Allow enabling anonymous access on individual containers** is checked. Check the setting if it is not enabled, and then select **Review**.
    
1. On the **Review** tab, review the options that you selected during the previous steps.

1. Select **Create** to create the storage account by using your specified configuration.

    > **Note**: Wait for the creation task to complete before you move forward with this lab.

1. Select **Go to resource**.

1. On the **Storage account** blade, in the **Settings** section, select the **Endpoints** link.

1. In the **Endpoints** section, copy the value of the **Blob Service** text box to the clipboard.

    > **Note**: You'll use this endpoint value later in the lab.

1. Open Notepad, and then paste the copied blob service value to Notepad.

1. On the **Storage account** blade, in the **Security + networking** section, select **Access keys**.

1. Copy the **Storage account name** value to the clipboard and then paste it into Notepad.

1. On the **Access keys** blade, select **Show** for either one of the **Key** text boxes. It does not matter which you use, they are interchangeable.

1. Review any one of the keys, and then copy the value of either of the **Key** boxes to the clipboard and then paste it into Notepad.

    > **Note**: You'll use all these values later in this lab.

#### Review

In this exercise, you created a new Storage account to use throughout the remainder of the lab.

### Exercise 2: Upload a blob into a container

#### Task 1: Create storage account containers

1. On the **Storage account** blade, select the **Containers** link in the **Data storage** section.

1. In the **Containers** section, select **+ Container**.

1. In the **New container** pop-up window, perform the following actions, and then select **Create**:

    | Setting | Action |
    | -- | -- |
    | **Name** text box | Enter **raster-graphics** |
    | **Public access level** drop-down list | Select **Private (no anonymous access)** |

1. In the **Containers** section, select **+ Container**.

1. In the **New container** pop-up window, perform the following actions and then select **Create**:

    | Setting | Action |
    | -- | -- |
    | **Name** text box | Enter **compressed-audio** |
    | **Public access level** drop-down list | Select **Private (no anonymous access)** |

1. In the **Containers** section, observe the updated list of containers.

    The following screenshot displays the configured settings on the **Create a storage account blade**.

#### Task 2: Upload a storage account blob

1. In the **Containers** section, select the recently created **raster-graphics** container.

1.	On the **Container** blade, select **Upload**.

1.	In the **Upload blob** window, perform the following actions, and then select **Upload**:

   | Setting | Action |
   | -- | -- |
   | **Files** section | Select **Browse for files** or use the drag and drop feature |
   | **File Explorer** window | Browse to **Allfiles (F):\\Allfiles\\Labs\\03\\Starter\\Images**, select the **graph.jpg** file, and then select **Open** |
   | **Overwrite if files already exist** check box | Ensure that the check box is selected |
   
   > **Note**: Wait for the blob to upload before you continue with this lab.

#### Task 3: Upload a new blob by using the portal

1. On the Azure portal's **navigation** pane, select the **Resource groups** link.

1. On the **Resource groups** blade, select the **StorageMedia** resource group that you created previously in this lab.

1. On the **StorageMedia** blade, select the **mediastor**_[yourname]_ storage account that you created previously in this lab.

1. On the **Storage account** blade, select the **Containers** link in the **Data storage** section.

1. In the **Containers** section, select the newly created **vector-graphics** container. You might need to refresh the page to observe the new container.

1.	On the **Container** blade, select **Upload**.

1.	In the **Upload blob** window, perform the following actions, and then select **Upload**:

    | Setting | Action |
    | -- | -- |
    | **Files** section | Select **Browse for files** or use the drag and drop feature |
    | **File Explorer** window |  **Allfiles (F):\\Allfiles\\Labs\\03\\Starter\\Images**, select the **graph.svg** file, and then select **Open** |
    | **Overwrite if files already exist** check box | Ensure that the check box is selected |

    > **Note**: Wait for the blob to upload before you continue with this lab.

#### Review

In this exercise, you created placeholder containers in the Storage account, and then populated each of the containers with a blob.
